            <h2 class = 'worldclass'>ADA University is a world-class university in Azerbaijan.</h2>
            <p class = 'adainfo'>A relatively new university, ADA University was founded in 2014. It was formed as a result of the Azerbaijan
            Diplomatic Academy and the Information Technologies University merging. The university was initially established
            to train specialists for a diplomatic career in Azerbaijani Foreign Affairs but has since expanded its academic
            courses.<br><br>
            The university is located in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. Situated 28 metres below sea level, the city is
            the lowest lying national capital in the world. The city is Azerbaijan's cultural, industrial, and scientific
            centre, as well as being its only metropolis. In 2000, Baku's Old City and its historical landmarks,
            Shirvanshah's Palace and Maiden Tower, were declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites.<br><br>
            There are four schools at the university offering both undergraduate and graduate degrees. They include the
            School of Business, School of Education, School of IT and Engineering, and School of Public and International
            Affairs.<br><br>
            At the heart of the university are its core values: academic excellence, accountability and shared governance,
            honour, integrity and transparency, diversity, collaboration and communication, and social responsibility. The
            university fulfils its value of diversity by welcoming international students from 46 countries around the
            world. This creates a multicultural environment that enriches the student experience.<br><br>
            Student life is an important part of the university. There are various clubs and societies available for
            students to participate in, such as arts and creativity club, book club, and politics club. Annually the
            university hosts the Haji Zeynalabdin Taghiyev Awards to reward the three student clubs that best demonstrate
            social responsibility.<br><br></p>
