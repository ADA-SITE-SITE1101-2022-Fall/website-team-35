                <p>Hour of Code was firstly launched by Code.org during Computer Science Education Week from December 9 to December 15,
                    2013. The Hour of Code is designed to introduce people to coding, as well as get them familiarized with coding. This is
                    done by hosting hour-long activities which are supposedly engaging and/or educational. The goals of the Hour of Code are
                    to inspire students, create Computer Science classes, prepare teachers for teaching Computer Science, etc. It was also
                    supported by several educational online learning platforms. About 20 million people
                    participated and over 600 million lines of code had been written. Hour of Code usually occurs starting on the second
                    Tuesday of December and ends on the third Tuesday of the month. In the past couple of years, it has increased the number
                    of Scratchers registered. By October 2014, about forty million students had taken the Hour of Code class, and
                    a second Hour of Code was held in December 2014.</p>
