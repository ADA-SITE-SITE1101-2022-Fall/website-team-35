                    <p>Hour of Code is a global movement that motivates students to learn about programming principles
                        in a fun and entertaining way. Recently we had our own Hour of Code in Baku. It was quite fascinating for
                        us to work with children and explain key elements of programming. More information about hour of code
                        can be obtained <a href = "hourofcode.html">here.</a> Moreover, if you want to know how we organized Hour of
