                        Our goal in creating this site is to gain new experiences in HTML and CSS. It is a great
                        opportunity to expand our knowledge for our future.

                    <h4>Hour of Code is a global movement that motivates students to learn about programming principles
                        in a fun and entertaining way. Recently we had our own Hour of Code in Baku. It was quite fascinating for
                        us to work with children and explain key elements of programming. More information can be obtained <a href = "hourofcode.html">here.</a></h4>
